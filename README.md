# FGOPrototype
Solo Project - Trying to recreate FGO in console

I have always been fascinated by Pokemon and I've always loved the game. My aim is to try and recreate a game like Pokemon in console or whichever way I can.
To do this, I want to understand the mechanics and how stuff is programmed. Recently, I've been spending a lot of time playing Fate/Grand Order (FGO).
While playing, I felt like there's a lot of mechanics that I could use in both places. This is mostly a project I'm doing to learn and understand more about
games programming and to level up my own skills further.

So, in this project, I aim to understand and learn how to implement several features like levelling up, equipping items, etc. and hopefully transfer these skills 
into my future projects.
